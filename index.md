I am a PhD candidate at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS][ufrgs]{:target="_blank"}), working on the automatic design of heuristic algorithms for binary combinatorial optimization problems under supervision of Dr. Marcus Ritt. I am a professor of artificial intelligence in the Software Engineering department at the Santa Catarina State University ([UDESC][udesc]{:target="_blank"} -- [Ibirama Campus][udesc-ibirama]{:target="_blank"}). I am also a visiting researcher at the Alliance Manchester Business School ([AMBS][ambs]{:target="_blank"}) of The University of Manchester ([UoM][uom]{:target="_blank"}), in collaboration with Dr. Manuel L칩pez-Ib치침ez.

I received a MSc degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), under the supervision of [Dr. Ana Bazzan][bazzan]{:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Marcus Ritt][ritt]{:target="_blank"}. My master thesis addressed bi-objective traffic assignment methods for electric vehicles. I also received a BSc degree in Information Systems at the Santa Catarina State University (UDESC), with partial completion at University of Le칩n ([Unileon][unileon]{:target="_blank"} -- Spain).

I am particularly interested in automatic algorithm configuration and the improvement of the existing configuration tools, such as irace. Currently, I am developing capping strategies to speed up the configuration process. I am also interested in heuristic algorithms and their application to solve combinatorial optimization problems. For additional information about my research topics, see my [research](research.html) and [publications](publications.html) pages.
